# Diabetic Retinopathy
This project main aim is to detect the Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) using 7 circle segmented images. Here we use resnet-50 model to detect the DR.

## Folder Description : 
This repository contains 2 notebooks which are 
1. DR_preprocessing.ipynb : This notebook help us to segment the original DR images. Here we employ 7 circle segmentation.
2. DR_praneeth.ipynb : This notebook contains the model implementation for DR detection using resnet-50

### Dataset Used :
We use the DR dataset that is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data)


Note : This is tensorflow version we have pytorch version of it.
